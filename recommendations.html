            <p>
                It is with pleasure that I write a recommendation for Julie Carlson, aka Juliana Snow.  Having worked with Julie as a peer for 2 years and a manager for 1 year, I am increasignly impressed with her consistant punctuality, unrelenting job performance, versatility, and relations with co-workers and customers.
            </p>
            <p>Julie makes it her priority to be at least 5 minutes early to work during every shift.  She is a steady worker who is very reliable and can always be counted on to assist or lead any activity asked of her.  I can always count on Julie to take the reigns when a manager is not present.  She helps keep other employees on track and on the task to be done.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that when a job is to be done, Julie is the first to get started.  When asked to complete a task, she is diligent and complete.  She goes to her work with zest and consistantly goes above and beyond what is asked.  Julie also takes initiative to seek out tasks on her own.  She has a good eye on what needs to be accomplished.  </p>
            <p>A great quality about Julie is her flexability.  She has worked at two locations requiring separate tasks.  Working aloneat one location has required her to be fully responsible for customer service, inventory, and computing sales.  She has taken on the responsibility with ease.</p>
            <p>When working at our other location, she is well-liked and respected by all of her co-workers and customers.  She has a pleasant disposition and her friendly additude makes her a joy to work with.</p>
            <p>Julie has been a wonderful asset to our company and I would happily recommend her for whatever endeavour she may choose.</p>
