I ended up a 4.5-star to a 5-star driver.  People enjoyed their ride and requested I be their driver at other times during their stay.  When Covid came in 2020, I decided that I didn't want to risk anyone getting sick, or the passing of any sickness from one pick-up to another, so I hung-up the keys for a while and began the Rochester United Mask Making Group.</td>
